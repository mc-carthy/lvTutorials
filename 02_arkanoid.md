## Introduction

Arkanoid (or Breakout as it is often known) is a natural progression in terms of development from Pong. It shares several features that we have already tackled, such as the paddle movement, the ball bouncing off walls and colliding with paddles, as well as reacting to the ball falling out of the screen area. However it requires enough new features to represent a step up in development complexity. In this tutorial, we'll look into representing objects as Lua tables (a step towards an object-oriented approach), splitting our code across multiple files to aid mantainability and clarity, more advanced collision detection & resolution logic, and much more!

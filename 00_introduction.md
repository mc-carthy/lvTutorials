# Introduction

So you want to know what LÖVE is, and you want me to show you...

Before we get into that, here's a quick summary of the tools we're going to be using to build our games, and how to get up and running.

We're going to use a framework called LÖVE to build our games, which you can download [here](https://love2d.org/). LÖVE uses a scripting language called Lua. 

Lua is a relatively simple and lightweight programming language. If you have previous experience with programming languages (especially other scripting languages), you should feel right at home. If you're new to programming, it's a great language to start with. There are relatively few built-in functions and data types, so hopefully you'll get up to speed quite quickly! If you want to read more on Lua, the first edition of Programming in Lua is available for free online [here](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html). But we'll cover the essentials in the following tutorials.

In order to write our games, we'll need a text editor. You can use whatever you like (notepad, SublimeText, vim etc.), but I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which has some very useful plugins including [Lua language support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=keyring.Lua) as well as a [LÖVE plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pixelbyte-studios.pixelbyte-love2d) that includes snippets for the LÖVE API, as well as allowing your project to be run directly from VSCode (you'll need to configure the settings of that plugin to point to where you installed LÖVE).

With that all said and done, let's get coding!
